# n8n-nodes-prestashop

This is an n8n community node. It lets you integrate [PrestaShop](https://www.prestashop.com/) Webservice/API in your n8n workflows.

It supports both **actions** (managing main resources) and **triggers** (listening for new entities created in PrestaShop).

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.
